# SentinelShare

# SentinelShare

**SentinelShare** is an automated financial guardian for your household. It quietly monitors your email inboxes, intelligently detects receipts (from Amazon, recurring subscriptions, etc.), and forwards them to your partner or accountant.

## 💡 The Problem

Keeping family finances in sync is hard. One person buys something on Amazon, but the receipt gets buried in their personal inbox. The other person (or the accountant) has to chase them down for "that $49.99 charge".

## ✅ The Solution

SentinelShare solves this by:

1.  **Watching**: Connecting securely to your Gmail/iCloud.
2.  **Filtering**: Ignoring spam, shipping updates, and promos.
3.  **Forwarding**: Sending _only_ the actual receipts to a designated email.
4.  **Managing**: Providing a unified dashboard to track what's been shared.

It turns a manual chore into a "set it and forget it" background process.

## 🚀 Features

- **Smart Receipt Detection**: Automatically identifies receipts from retailers like Amazon, Starbucks, Apple, and more, separating them from shipping notifications and promotional spam.
- **Multi-Account Support**: Connects to multiple IMAP accounts (Gmail, iCloud) to monitor for receipts.
- **Intelligent Forwarding**: Forwards detected receipts to a target email address with a rich, summary header.
- **Smart Actions**:
  - **Block**: Stop forwarding specific senders or categories with one click.
  - **Always Forward**: Whitelist senders to ensure they are never missed.
  - **Settings**: Manage preferences directly from the forwarded email or the dashboard.
- **Modern Web Dashboard**:
  - **Activity Feed**: Real-time log of processed emails.
  - **History**: Searchable history of all actions.
  - **Stats**: Visual breakdown of forwarded vs. blocked emails and spending over time.
  - **Settings**: Configure manual rules, manage blocking lists, and edit email templates.
- **Rich Email Templates**: Customizable, beautiful HTML templates for forwarded emails.
